;              _pd_block_id is used to assign a unique ID code to a data block.
               This code is then used for references between different blocks
               (see _pd_block_diffractogram_id, _pd_calib_std_external_block_id
               and _pd_phase_block_id).

               Note that a data block may contain only a single diffraction
               data set or information about a single crystalline phase. 
               However, a single diffraction measurement may yield structural 
               information on more than one phase, or a single structure 
               determination may use more than one data set. Alternatively, 
               results from a single data set, such as calibration parameters 
               from measurements of a standard, may be used for many subsequent 
               analyses. Through use of the ID code, a reference made between 
               data sets may be preserved when the file is exported from the 
               laboratory from which the CIF originated.

               The ID code assigned to each data block should be unique with
               respect to an ID code assigned for any other data block in the
               world. The naming scheme chosen for the block-ID format is
               designed to ensure uniqueness.

               It is the responsibility of a data archive site or local
               laboratory to create a catalogue of block ID's if that site
               wishes to resolve these references.

               diffraction data contained in a data block other
               than the current block. This will occur most frequently
               when more than one set of diffraction data
               is used for a structure determination. The data
               block containing the diffraction data will contain
               a _pd_block_id code matching the code in
               _pd_block_diffractogram_id.

;              Used to assign a unique character string to a block.
               Note that this code is not intended to be parsed; the
               concatenation of several strings is used in order to
               generate a string that can reasonably be expected to
               be unique.

               This code is assigned by the originator of the data set and
               is used for references between different CIF blocks.
               The ID will normally be created when the block is first
               created. It is possible to loop more than one ID for a
               block: if changes or additions are made to the
               block later, a new ID may be assigned, but the original name
               should be retained.

               The format for the ID code is:
                 <date-time>|<block_name>|<creator_name>|<instr_name>

                <date-time>    is the date and time the CIF was created
                               or modified.

                <block_name>   is an arbitrary name assigned by the
                               originator of the data set. It will
                               usually match the name of the phase
                               and possibly the name of the current CIF
                               data block (i.e. the string xxxx in a
                               data_xxxx identifier). It may be a sample name.

                <creator_name> is the name of the person who measured the
                               diffractogram, or prepared or modified the CIF.

                <instr_name>  is a unique name (as far as possible) for
                               the data-collection instrument, preferably
                               containing the instrument serial number for
                               commercial instruments. It is also possible to
                               use the Internet name or address for the
                               instrument computer as a unique name.

               As blocks are created in a CIF, the original sample identifier
               (i.e. <block_name>) should be retained, but the <creator_name>
               may be changed and the <date-time> will always change.
               The <date-time> will usually match either the
               _pd_meas_datetime_initiated or the _pd_proc_info_datetime
               entry.

               Within each section of the code, the following characters
               may be used:
                             A-Z a-z 0-9 # & * . : , - _ + / ( ) \ [ ]

               The sections are separated with vertical rules '|' which are
               not allowed within the sections. Blank spaces may also
               not be used.  Capitalization may be used within the ID code
               but should not be considered significant - searches for
               data-set ID names should be case-insensitive.

               Date-time entries are in the standard CIF format
               'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+zz' Use of seconds and a time zone
               is optional, but use of hours and minutes is strongly
               encouraged as this will help ensure that the ID code is unique.

               An archive site that wishes to make CIFs available via
               the web may substitute the URL for the file containing the
               appropriate block for the final two sections of the ID
               (<creator_name> and <instr_name>). Note that this should
               not be done unless the archive site is prepared to keep the
               file available online indefinitely.

    _definition
;              This section contains the measured diffractogram and information
               about the conditions used for the measurement of the diffraction 
               data set, prior to processing and application of correction
               terms. While additional information may be added to the CIF
               as data are processed and transported between laboratories
               (possibly with the addition of a new _pd_block_id entry), the
               information in this section of the CIF will rarely be changed
               once data collection is complete.

               Where possible, measurements in this section should have no
               post-collection processing applied (normalizations, corrections,
               smoothing, zero-offset corrections etc.). Such corrected
               measurements should be recorded in the _pd_proc_ section.

               Data sets that are measured as counts, where a standard
               uncertainty can be considered equivalent to the standard
               deviation and where the standard deviation can be estimated
               as the square root of the number of counts recorded, should
               use the _pd_meas_counts_ fields. All other intensity values
               should be recorded using _pd_meas_intensity_.

               points measured in a scanning method. The scan method used
               (e.g. continuous or step scan) should be specified in
               the item _pd_meas_scan_method. For fixed 2\q (white-beam)
               experiments, use _pd_meas_2theta_fixed. In the case of
               continuous-scan data sets, the 2\q value should be the
               value at the midpoint of the counting period. Associated
               with each _pd_meas_2theta_scan value will be
               _pd_meas_counts_ items. The 2\q values should
               not be corrected for nonlinearity,
               zero offset etc. Corrected values may be specified
               using _pd_proc_2theta_corrected.

               Note that for data sets collected with constant step size,
               _pd_meas_2theta_range_ (*_min, *_max and *_inc) may be

                   incident-beam monitor to calibrate the flux on the 
                   specimen.

               Corrections for background, detector dead time etc.
               should not have been made to these values. Instead use
               _pd_proc_intensity_ for corrected diffractograms.

               Note that counts-per-second values should be converted to
               total counts. If the counting time varies for different
               points, it may be included in the loop using
               _pd_meas_step_count_time.

               Standard uncertainties should not be quoted for these values.
               If the standard uncertainties differ from the square root of
               the number of counts, _pd_meas_intensity_ should be used.

                 _pd_meas_intensity_monitor, intensity measured by an

               Use these entries for measurements where intensity
               values are not counts (use _pd_meas_counts_ for event-counting

;              A linear distance in millimetres corresponding to the
               location where an intensity measurement is made.
               Used for detectors where a distance measurement is made
               as a direct observable, such as from a microdensitometer
               trace from film or a strip chart recorder. This is an
               alternative to _pd_meas_2theta_scan, which should only be
               used for instruments that record intensities directly
               against 2\q. For instruments where the position scale
               is nonlinear, the data item _pd_meas_detector_id should
               be used to record positions.

               function to convert this distance to a 2\q angle
               or d-space, should be supplied with the _pd_calib_ values.

                2\q~setting~ as a function of the channel number (CC). In
                addition to CH~0~, variables P~0~, P~1~ and P~2~ are
                calibration constants, where P~0~ is the width of a PSD
                channel in degrees, P~1~ is the angle of the PSD with respect

               used to calibrate 2\q (as defined in _pd_meas_2theta_).
               Calibration is done by adding the offset:

                    2\q~calibrated~ = 2\q~measured~ + 2\q~offset~

               For cases where the _pd_calib_2theta_offset value is
               not a constant, but rather varies with 2\q, a set
               of offset values can be supplied in a loop. In this case,
               the value where the offset has been determined can be
               specified as _pd_calib_2theta_off_point. Alternatively, a
               range where the offset is applicable can be specified using

               are relevant here. For example, use:
                 _diffrn_radiation_wavelength for the source wavelength,
                 _diffrn_radiation_type for the X-ray wavelength type,
                 _diffrn_source for the radiation source,
                 _diffrn_radiation_polarisn_ratio for the source polarization,
                 _diffrn_radiation_probe for the radiation type.
               For data sets measured with partially monochromatized radiation,
               for example, where both K\a~1~ and K\a~2~ are present, it is
               important that all wavelengths present are included in a
               loop_ using _diffrn_radiation_wavelength to define the 
               wavelength and _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_wt to define the 
               relative intensity of that wavelength. It is required that 
               _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_id also be present in the 
               wavelength loop. It may also be useful to
               create a "dummy" ID to use for labelling
               peaks/reflections where the K\a~1~ and K\a~2~ wavelengths are
               not resolved. Set _diffrn_radiation_wavelength_wt to be 0 for
               such a dummy ID.

               In the _pd_instr_ definitions, the term monochromator refers
               to a primary beam (pre-specimen) monochromator and the term
               analyser refers to post-diffraction (post-specimen)
               monochromator.  The analyser may be fixed for specific
               wavelength or may be capable of being scanned.

               For multiple-detector instruments it may be necessary to loop the
               *_anal/detc or *_spec/detc values (for  _pd_instr_dist_,
               _pd_instr_divg_, _pd_instr_slit_ and  _pd_instr_soller_) with
               the detector ID's (_pd_calib_detector_id).

               It is strongly recommended that the core dictionary term
               _diffrn_radiation_probe (specifying the nature of the radiation
               used) is employed for all data sets.

               Use _pd_instr_monochr_pre_spec to describe the primary beam
               monochromator (pre-specimen monochromation). Use
               _pd_instr_monochr_post_spec to specify the
               post-diffraction analyser (post-specimen monochromation).

               When a monochromator crystal is used, the material and the
               indices of the Bragg reflection are specified.

               Note that monochromators may have either 'parallel' or
               'antiparallel' orientation. It is assumed that the
               geometry is parallel unless specified otherwise.
               In a parallel geometry, the position of the monochromator
               allows the incident beam and the final post-specimen
               and post-monochromator beam to be as close to parallel
               as possible. In a parallel geometry, the diffracting
               planes in the specimen and monochromator will be parallel
               when 2\q~monochromator~ is equal to 2\q~specimen~.

    _definition
;              _pd_proc_intensity_net contains intensity values for the
               processed diffractogram for each data point (see
               _pd_proc_2theta_, _pd_proc_wavelength etc.) after
               correction and normalization factors have been applied
               (in contrast to _pd_meas_counts_ values, which are
               uncorrected).

               _pd_proc_intensity_total contains intensity values for the
               processed diffractogram for each data point where
               background, normalization and other corrections have not
               been applied.

               Inclusion of s.u.'s for these values is strongly recommended.

               _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_calc is intended to contain the
               background intensity for every data point where the
               background function has been fitted or estimated (for example, in
               all Rietveld and profile fits).

               If the background is estimated for a limited number of points
               and the calculated background is then extrapolated from
               these fixed points, indicate the background values for
               these points with _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_fix. Use a value
               of '.' for data points where a fixed background has not
               been defined. The extrapolated background at every point
               may be specified using _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_calc.

               Background values should be on the same scale as the
               _pd_proc_intensity_net values. Thus normalization and
               correction factors should be applied before
               background subtraction (or should be applied to the
               background values equally).

               If the intensities have been corrected for a variation of the
               incident intensity as a function of a data-collection
               variable (examples: source fluctuations in synchrotrons,
               \q-compensated slits in conventional diffractometers,
               spectral corrections for white-beam experiments), the
               correction function should be specified as
               _pd_proc_intensity_incident. The normalization should be
               specified in _pd_proc_intensity_incident as a value to be
               used to divide the measured intensities to obtained the
               normalized diffractogram. Thus, the
               _pd_proc_intensity_incident values should increase as the
               incident flux is increased.

               The other normalization factors applied to the data set (for
               example, Lp corrections, compensation for variation in
               counting time) may be specified in _pd_proc_intensity_norm.
               The function should be specified as the one used to divide the
               measured intensities.

               For refinements where the background is computed as a
               function that is fitted to minimize the difference between 
               the observed and calculated patterns, it is
               recommended that in addition to a description of the
               function (e.g. Chebychev polynomial), the actual equation(s)
               used are included in TeX, or a programming language such
               as Fortran or C. Include also the values used for the
               coefficients used in the background function with their
               s.u.'s. The background values for each data point
               computed from the function should be specified in
               _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_calc.

               If background correction is performed using extrapolation
               from a set of points at fixed locations, these points
               should be defined using _pd_proc_intensity_bkg_fix, and
               _pd_proc_ls_background_function should indicate the

               each data point should be specified in

               using the extracted reflection intensity values (often
               called the Rietveld or Bragg R factor, R~B~) is not properly
               a profile R factor. This R factor may be specified using
               _refine_ls_R_I_factor. (Some authors report
               _refine_ls_R_Fsqd_factor or _refine_ls_R_factor_all
               as the Rietveld or Bragg R factor. While it is appropriate
               to compute and report any or all of these R factors,
               the names "Rietveld or Bragg R factor" refer strictly to
               _refine_ls_R_I_factor.)

              _pd_proc_ls_prof_R_factor, often called R~p~, is an
                unweighted fitness metric for the agreement between the
                observed and computed diffraction patterns.
                   R~p~ = sum~i~ | I~obs~(i) - I~calc~(i) |

              _pd_proc_ls_prof_wR_factor, often called R~wp~, is a
                weighted fitness metric for the agreement between the
                observed and computed diffraction patterns.
                  R~wp~ = SQRT {

              _pd_proc_ls_prof_wR_expected, sometimes called the
                theoretical R~wp~ or R~exp~, is a weighted fitness metric for
                the statistical precision of the data set. For an idealized fit,
                where all deviations between the observed intensities and
                those computed from the model are due to statistical
                fluctuations, the observed R~wp~ should match the expected
                R factor. In reality, R~wp~ will always be higher than
                R~exp~.

               measured or, if present, the processed diffractogram. Each
               peak in this table will have a unique label (see _pd_peak_id).
               The reflections and phases associated with each peak will be
               specified in other sections (see the _pd_refln_ and
               _pd_phase_ sections).

               Note that peak positions are customarily determined from the
               processed diffractogram and thus corrections for position
               and intensity will have been previously applied.

    _definition
;              The observed and calculated linear attenuation coefficient,
               \m, in units of inverse millimetres. Note that this quantity
               is sometimes referred to as the mass absorption coefficient;
               however, this term accounts for other potentially significant
               losses of incident radiation, for example incoherent
               scattering of neutrons.

               The calculated \m will be obtained from the atomic content of
               the cell, the average density (allowing for specimen packing)
               and the radiation wavelength. The observed \m will be
               determined by a transmission measurement.
               Note that _pd_char_atten_coef_mu_calc will differ from
               _exptl_absorpt_coefficient_mu if the packing density is
               not unity.

;              The colour of the material used for the measurement.
               To facilitate more standardized use of names, the
               following guidelines for colour naming developed by
               Peter Bayliss for the International Centre for 
               Diffraction Data (ICDD) should be followed. Note that
               combinations of descriptors are separated by an
               underscore.

               Allowed colours are:
                 colourless, white, black, gray, brown, red, pink,
                 orange, yellow, green, blue, violet.

               Colours may be modified using prefixes of:
                 light, dark, whitish, blackish, grayish, brownish,
                 reddish, pinkish, orangish, yellowish, greenish, bluish.

               Intermediate hues may be indicated with two colours:
               e.g. blue_green or bluish_green.

               For metallic materials, the term metallic may be added:
               e.g. reddish_orange_metallic for copper.

               The ICDD standard allows commas to be used for minerals
               that occur with ranges of colours; however this usage is
               not appropriate for the description of a single sample.

    _definition
;              The PD_DATA category contains raw, processed and calculated
               data points in a diffraction data set. In many cases, it is
               convenient to tabulate calculated values against the
               raw and processed measurements, and so the various
               _pd_meas_, _pd_proc_ and _pd_calc_ data items belonging
               to this category may be looped together. In some instances,
               however, it makes more sense to maintain separate tables of
               the data contributing to the measured and processed
               diffractograms (for example, a profile may be calculated
               at 2theta values different from those of the measured
               data points). To facilitate the identification of equivalent
               points in these separate tables, separate identifiers are
               defined.
